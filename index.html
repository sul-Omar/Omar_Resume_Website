    <h1>Omar Hategekimana Mbabonabaseka</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      I am an energetic and purpose-driven data engineer and data scientist who thrives at the intersection of complex data systems and real-world impact. With every project I take on, I bring relentless curiosity, technical precision, and a deep passion for transforming raw data into powerful insights and intelligent solutions. Whether I'm building scalable pipelines, engineering efficient data architectures, or unlocking patterns through analytics and machine learning, I approach each challenge with the mindset of an innovator and the discipline of a craftsman. Data isn’t just my profession — it’s the language I use to solve problems, drive innovation, and fuel transformation in every space I enter.
